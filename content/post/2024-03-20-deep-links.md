Deep linking is a way to open a specific screen in your app from a URL. It's a common practice for apps to support deep linking, especially when they have a lot of content. The similar approach also works for other purposes like opening a specific screen from a push notification.

## What is a deep link?

A deep link is a URL that opens a specific screen in your app. For example, if you have a news app, you might want to open a specific article when the user taps on a link in an email or a message. Deep links are a great way to provide a seamless experience for your users.

## How to implement deep links in SwiftUI

To implement deep links in SwiftUI, we need to use the `onOpenURL` modifier. This modifier allows us to handle deep links in our app. Here's an example of how to use it:

```swift
import SwiftUI

@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .onOpenURL { url in
                    // Handle the deep link
                }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we use the `onOpenURL` modifier to handle deep links in our app. When a deep link is opened, the closure passed to `onOpenURL` is called, and we can handle the deep link there.

## Conclusion

In this article, we learned how to implement deep links in SwiftUI. Deep links are a great way to provide a seamless experience for your users, and they're easy to implement in SwiftUI. I hope this article helps you get started with deep links in your app!
